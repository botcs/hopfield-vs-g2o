# Hopfield Network versus Greedy 2 opt
## on TSP


### Neural Network assignment:
An application where a graphical interface enables to create a route (or save/load if necessary) and able to optimize the length of the route in two ways, with:

* a modified Hopfield Network [link](http://www.mini.pw.edu.pl/~mandziuk/PRACE/TSP_DM.pdf)
* a greedy algorithm enhanced with 2-opt [link](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-053-optimization-methods-in-management-science-spring-2013/lecture-notes/MIT15_053S13_lec17.pdf) 

The Greedy 2 Opt was written in C++ using my previous implementation of the [KDtree](https://github.com/botcs/KD-tree)

The modified Hopfield Network is implemented in a Python backend, with which I wanted to study the communciation between two application
