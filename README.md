# Hopfield Network versus Greedy 2 opt
## on TSP


### Neural Network assignment:
An application where a graphical interface enables to create a route (or save/load if necessary) and able to optimize the length of the route in two ways, with a modified Hopfield Network (http://www.mini.pw.edu.pl/~mandziuk/PRACE/TSP_DM.pdf), and a greedy algorithm enhanced with 2-opt (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-053-optimization-methods-in-management-science-spring-2013/lecture-notes/MIT15_053S13_lec17.pdf)
